## 🔐 Password Generator Web App (Flask + Jinja2)
This is a lightweight, configurable password generation tool built using Flask and Jinja2. It allows users to generate secure passwords based on custom inputs, such as:
- Desired password length
- Certain Keys which will make sure your have a unique password.
<!-- - Inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols -->
- Optional filters for readability (e.g. avoiding ambiguous characters)
